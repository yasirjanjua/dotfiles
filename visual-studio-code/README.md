# Visual Studio Code tricks&tips

> Have a look at our default config in [`settings.json`](settings.json).

## Use of the install script

First of all, make sure you've installed Visual Studio Code and went through [this process](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_command-line) to install `code` shell command.

Now run these commands:

```sh
cd YOUR_PATH_TO_ALL_YOUR_REPOS/dotfiles
cd ./config/visual-studio-code
./install.sh
```

The script asks you if you want to install the extensions. Type `y` for yes. Defaults to no. 

`Do you want to install VSC extensions? [y|N]`

This will install or update to the last version all the extensions [listed below] (#useful-extensions)

Then you will be asked if you want to overwrite your own config.

`Do you want to overwrite user config? [y|N]`

If you answer `y`, you will have the possibility to save your previous config as a backup.

`Do you want to back up your current user config? [Y|n]`

Then the script will overwrite your current user config.

You will need to restart your Visual Studio Code for all the above to take effect.
